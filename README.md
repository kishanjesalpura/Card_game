# Card_game

## (All the files are in the mater branc created by me)
### (master branch is below the main branch when clicking on the main drop down menu)

### How to run the programme?

 - I have not used any modules/libraries outside that of python's default provided modules.
 - Not that this programme will work on python version 3.5 and above
 - To run the programme just run the casino.py programme in the terminal.
 - After the 4 rounds are over every client will be asked wether it wants to continue the game.
 - If all clients agree then only the server will conitnue.
 - Else the server will exit as well as all the clients.
